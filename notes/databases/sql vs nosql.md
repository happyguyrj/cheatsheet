## Type
- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)
- NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

## Language
- SQL databases defines and manipulates data based structured query language (SQL).
- NoSQL: The syntax varies from database to database, and you can add fields as you go.

## Scalability
- SQL databases are vertically scalable
- NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable

## Structure
- SQL databases are table-based
- NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases or wide-column stores.

## Hierarchical data storage
- SQL is not most suited
- NoSQL databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.

## Property followed
- SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability)
- NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance).

## Examples
- SQL: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.
- NoSQL: Redis, RavenDB Cassandra, MongoDB, BigTable, HBase, Neo4j and CouchDB.
